# True Original Copy (TOC)

A backup and restore disaster recovery software to create and restore backups
between a local and remote site.

![TOC UI](../../wiki/assets/images/05-toc-progress.png)

*TOC* began life as a prototype to test out various modern software technologies 
for learning and experimentation. It uses the following technologies:

- [Vagrant][vagrant]
- [Docker][docker], [Docker Compose][docker-compose], [s6 process supervisor][s6-overlay]
- [Go][golang], [Swagger][swagger]
- [React framework][react]
- [Material Design for Bootstrap (MDB)][mdb]

> [!NOTE]
> Today, *the work is not yet finished* and TOC is still non-functional; TOC 
> remains a mock-up UI prototype with unfinished backend API services.
> 

> [!CAUTION]
> Do **NOT** use this for any important data.
